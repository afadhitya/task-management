# Product Requirements Document
## Task Management App — Backend (API) Platform

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** February 26, 2026  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Teams and individuals need a reliable, scalable backend service to power task management workflows. The system must expose a well-structured API that any frontend client (web app, mobile app, third-party integration) can consume to manage tasks, users, projects, and collaboration.

### 1.2 Product Vision
A robust, RESTful backend service for task management — designed to be secure, performant, and extensible — serving individual users through enterprise-scale teams from a single platform.

### 1.3 Goals
- Provide a complete API surface for all task management operations
- Support multi-tenancy for individual, team, and enterprise workspaces
- Enforce role-based access control at every layer
- Be frontend-agnostic — any client can integrate against the API

---

## 2. Target Consumers of the API

| Consumer Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Web frontend clients | Browser-based SPAs or SSR apps |
| Mobile clients | iOS / Android apps (future) |
| Third-party integrations | Slack, GitHub, Zapier, etc. |
| Internal services | Notification workers, reporting jobs |
| API users / developers | Direct API access via tokens |

---

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Architecture Style
- **Primary:** RESTful API (JSON over HTTPS)
- **Real-time:** WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates (notifications, task changes) — post-MVP

## 6. Authentication & Authorization

### 6.1 Authentication Flow
- JWT-based with short-lived access tokens (15 min) and long-lived refresh tokens (30 days)
- Refresh tokens stored in Redis with rotation on use
- OAuth 2.0 support: Google (MVP), GitHub (post-MVP)
- Enterprise: SAML 2.0 / SSO (post-MVP)

### 6.2 Authorization Model (RBAC)
| Role | Scope | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | Workspace | Full access, billing, delete workspace |
| Admin | Workspace | Manage members, projects, settings |
| Member | Workspace | Create/edit projects and tasks they have access to |
| Guest | Project | View/comment only on specific projects |

Project-level permissions override workspace defaults where stricter.

### 6.3 Security Filter Chain (Spring Security)
```
Request → CORS Filter → Rate Limit Filter → JWT Auth Filter → RBAC (Method Security) → Controller
```

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Performance
- API response time P95 < 300ms for standard reads
- Support 1,000 concurrent requests (MVP); horizontally scalable for enterprise
- Pagination required on all list endpoints (default limit: 50, max: 200)

### 7.2 Security
- All endpoints served over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor ≥ 12)
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints (prevent SQL injection, XSS payloads)
- Rate limiting: 100 req/min per user; 1,000 req/min per API key
- CORS policy configurable per workspace (enterprise)
- GDPR: data export and account deletion endpoints required

### 7.3 Reliability
- 99.9% uptime target
- Database connection pooling
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health`

### 7.4 Observability
- Structured JSON logging (request ID, user ID, latency, status)
- Error tracking (Sentry or equivalent)
- Metrics: request rate, error rate, DB query latency (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry — post-MVP)

## 8. Background Jobs & Workers

| Job | Trigger | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Email notifications | Task event (async via RabbitMQ) | Send assignment / mention / due date emails via Spring Mail |
| Due date reminders | `@Scheduled` cron (daily) | Notify users of tasks due in 24hrs |
| Recurring task generation | `@Scheduled` cron (configurable) | Auto-create next instance of recurring tasks |
| Attachment virus scan | Upload event (async) | Scan files before marking as available |
| Audit log archival | `@Scheduled` cron (monthly) | Archive old logs to cold storage (enterprise) |
| Search index sync | DB change event (Debezium CDC or app-level) | Keep search index up to date |

---

## 9. Out of Scope (v1.0)

- Any frontend UI or web client
- Native mobile API optimizations (GraphQL, offline sync) — v2
- Built-in video/voice/screen share
- Billing and subscription management (use Stripe directly)
- AI/ML features (smart prioritization, NLP task parsing)
- White-labeling infrastructure

---

## 10. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| API uptime | ≥ 99.9% |
| P95 response time | < 300ms |
| Error rate (5xx) | < 0.1% |
| Test coverage | ≥ 80% unit + integration |
| Time to first API response (onboarding) | < 5 min with docs |

---

## 11. Proposed Development Phases

| Phase | Scope | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — Core** | Auth, Users, Workspaces, Projects, Tasks (CRUD) | 4 weeks |
| **Phase 2 — Collaboration** | Comments, Assignees, Notifications, Attachments | 3 weeks |
| **Phase 3 — Organization** | Labels, Filters, Search, Bulk actions | 2 weeks |
| **Phase 4 — Enterprise** | RBAC hardening, Audit logs, SSO, Rate limiting | 3 weeks |
| **Phase 5 — Async & Scale** | Job queues, Recurring tasks, WebSockets, Observability | Ongoing |

---

## 12. Open Questions

1. Will the project use **Maven or Gradle** as the build tool?
2. Should the API be versioned from day one via URL path (e.g. `/api/v1/`)? Recommended: yes.
3. What is the expected scale at launch — how many workspaces / concurrent users?
4. Is there a preference for **self-hosted PostgreSQL** vs. a managed service (AWS RDS, Supabase)?
5. Should Redis be used for both caching and async pub/sub, or will a dedicated message broker (RabbitMQ) be introduced from the start?
6. Are there existing internal services this API needs to integrate with?
7. What is the deployment target — Docker + Kubernetes, AWS ECS, bare metal, or other?
