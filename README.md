# Task Management Backend API

A production-ready, RESTful backend service for task management — built with Java 17 and Spring Boot 4.0.3 following Clean Architecture principles. Designed to be secure, performant, and extensible.

---

## What This Project Does

This API powers task management workflows for teams and individuals. Any frontend client (web app, mobile app, third-party integration) can consume this API to manage:

- **Workspaces** — Multi-tenant environments with member roles
- **Projects** — Organize work within workspaces
- **Tasks** — Full CRUD with priorities, statuses, assignments, subtasks, bulk operations
- **Collaboration** — Comments on tasks, labels for categorization
- **Search** — Global search across tasks, projects, and users
- **Audit Logging** — Track changes for compliance

---

## Purpose of This Project

> This project is **evidence that human judgment remains essential** even with AI assistance in software development.

### AI Collaboration, Not Pure AI Generation

This project was built through **structured human-AI collaboration**:

| Phase | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **Planning** | Discussed with AI: architecture alternatives, tradeoffs, recommendations |
| **Design** | Evaluated AI suggestions, made final decisions on patterns |
| **Implementation** | AI generated code, human reviewed & validated every implementation |
| **Refinement** | Iterated based on human feedback on code quality & style |
| **Validation** | Human did code review, enforced standards |

### Why This Approach

The industry is moving toward "vibe coding" — letting AI generate everything. This project proves a different path:

- **AI is a tool, not a replacement** — It generates code, but humans decide *what* to build and *why*
- **Architectural thinking is human territory** — Understanding tradeoffs, pattern selection, system design
- **Human ownership matters** — When something breaks, you need to understand *why* it was built that way

This approach may not be as fast as pure vibe coding. But the human ownership gained — understanding every architectural decision, every pattern choice — cannot be generated by AI.
